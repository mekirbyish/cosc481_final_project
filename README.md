Abstract:Life expectancy has many variables at play, such as education level, where one lives, being female, among many others. Each country has different statistics for these variables to look into. We want to know; what factors are correlated to life expectancy of females as a percentage of males? Using the 2017 UNICEF dataset (https://www.unicef.org/sowc2017/) and data from the United Nations Statistics Division (http://data.un.org/), we graphed the data by each variable by other variables looking for outliers both high and low, to determine why these outliers exist, and how they change based on other variables. Looking into “Survival rate to the last grade of primary schools: females as a % of males”, we focused on countries that lied below 99.1825 and above 103.206. This allows us to look into if increasing or decreasing factors will have an effect on life expectancy, hopefully to find ways to increase life expectancy. We could then use our information on what causes the lower life expectancies to help those in at-risk regions work their way up to having longer life expectancies. This project created multiple graphs of each variable with the other variables, showing many outliers throughout the graphs. From this, we focused on the more extreme outliers as factors most affecting life expectancy of females as a percentage of males, removing the other countries when discussing their respective variables. After identifying these outlying countries, we drew conclusions on how to help increase female life expectancy in the determined locations. Supporting these countries will hopefully help fix some of the disparities encountered in our analysis.
